# Welcome to Remix + Vite!

ðŸ“– See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs) and the [Remix Vite docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/vite) for details on supported features.

## Typegen

Generate types for your Cloudflare bindings in `wrangler.toml`:

```sh
pnpm typegen
```

You will need to rerun typegen whenever you make changes to `wrangler.toml`.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

To run Wrangler:

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

## Deployment

If you don't already have an account, then [create a cloudflare account here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and after verifying your email address with Cloudflare, go to your dashboard and set up your free custom Cloudflare Workers subdomain.

Once that's done, you should be able to deploy your app:

```sh
pnpm run deploy
```
